# Canvas Slider

A small Image Slider rendered on `<canvas>` and only draggable through the mouse cursor.

# How it works

The images that you'd like to show on the Slider have to be included in the document's `body`, through a simple `<img/>` tag.

# Stuff used

* `Browserify/Watchify` for easy modules.
* `Babelify` for nice early ES6/ES2015 support.
* Some random images from Instagram and Dribbble as examples.

# Build

```coffee
npm install # to get all dependencies
npm start # to run watchify to auto compile on save
npm run build # to build the whole project
```
